# Backend Connection Status

## Current Issue
The app is configured to connect to `https://api.plantsgenius.site/api/trpc` but is receiving **404 errors**, indicating that:

1. **The backend is not deployed** at `https://api.plantsgenius.site`
2. **The API endpoint structure is different** than expected
3. **CORS or routing configuration** may need adjustment

## Error Details
```
ERROR [tRPC] 404 Error - endpoint not found: https://api.plantsgenius.site/api/trpc/auth.signUp
ERROR [Auth] Error message: The backend endpoint was not found. Please verify the API is deployed at https://api.plantsgenius.site
```

## What's Working
✅ **Guest Mode** - Users can continue using the app with limited features
✅ **Local Development** - Backend code exists in `backend/` directory
✅ **Error Handling** - Clear error messages direct users to Guest Mode
✅ **Environment Configuration** - `.env` file properly configured

## What Needs to Happen

### Option 1: Deploy Backend to Production
The backend needs to be deployed to `https://api.plantsgenius.site` with:
- tRPC endpoints accessible at `/api/trpc/*`
- MongoDB connection configured
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- All authentication routes working

### Option 2: Use API Documentation
According to the previous messages, there's API documentation at:
`https://app.gitbook.com/o/bGzRSCDZPZPoZGYDqihw/s/tFVMGP9J0b3cLQVDCOtm/`

The backend API may have a different structure than the tRPC setup. We may need to:
1. Access the API documentation (requires GitBook authentication)
2. Understand the actual endpoint structure
3. Adapt the app to use the correct API format

### Option 3: Verify Backend URL
The backend might be deployed at a different URL or path:
- Test: `https://api.plantsgenius.site/`
- Test: `https://api.plantsgenius.site/health`
- Test: `https://api.plantsgenius.site/trpc` (without `/api/`)

## Testing Backend Connectivity

### Manual Test
1. Open browser/Postman
2. Try: `https://api.plantsgenius.site/`
3. Try: `https://api.plantsgenius.site/api`
4. Try: `https://api.plantsgenius.site/health`

### Expected Response
If backend is working, you should see:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "PlantGenius Backend API is running",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Current App Behavior
- ✅ Shows clear error messages
- ✅ Suggests Guest Mode as fallback
- ✅ Logs detailed debugging information
- ✅ Handles 404, 500, timeout, and network errors
- ✅ All features work in Guest Mode

## User Experience
Users will see:
> ⚠️ Service Unavailable
> The authentication server is not deployed yet. Please use Guest Mode to explore the app.

This allows users to:
- Use Guest Mode with 2 daily scans
- Explore all features locally
- No data syncing to cloud (until backend is available)

## Next Steps
1. **Verify backend deployment status**
2. **Check API documentation for correct endpoint structure**
3. **Test backend connectivity manually**
4. **Update app if API structure is different**
5. **Deploy backend if not yet deployed**

## Files to Check
- `.env` - API_BASE_URL configuration
- `lib/trpc.ts` - tRPC client setup and error handling
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication logic
- `backend/hono.ts` - Local backend server (reference)
