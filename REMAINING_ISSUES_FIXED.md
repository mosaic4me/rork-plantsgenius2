# Remaining Issues Fixed

This document summarizes the final three issues that were addressed.

---

## Issue #1: Placeholder Email API ✅ FIXED

**Location:** `backend/trpc/routes/contact/send-email/route.ts:20`

### Problem
- Hardcoded placeholder API key: `'api-key-placeholder'`
- Contact form was non-functional

### Solution
1. Updated to read from environment variables:
   - `SMTP2GO_API_KEY` or `EXPO_PUBLIC_SMTP2GO_API_KEY`
   - `CONTACT_EMAIL` (default: programmerscourt@gmail.com)
   - `FROM_EMAIL` (default: fredcater101@gmail.com)

2. Added graceful fallback:
   ```typescript
   if (!SMTP2GO_API_KEY || SMTP2GO_API_KEY === '') {
     console.warn('[SendEmail] SMTP2GO_API_KEY not configured...');
     return { 
       success: false, 
       message: 'Email service is not configured. Please contact support directly at ' + CONTACT_EMAIL 
     };
   }
   ```

3. Added proper logging for debugging

### Setup Required
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
SMTP2GO_API_KEY=your_smtp2go_api_key
CONTACT_EMAIL=programmerscourt@gmail.com
FROM_EMAIL=fredcater101@gmail.com
```

Get your SMTP2GO API key from: https://www.smtp2go.com/

## Issue #2: Type Safety Issues ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Throughout codebase, routes were using unsafe `as any` type casting:
```typescript
router.push('/profile' as any);  // ❌ No type safety
```

### Solution
Created a typed routing utility at `lib/routes.ts`:

```typescript
export const AppRoutes = {
  tabs: '/(tabs)' as const,
  scan: '/scan' as const,
  history: '/history' as const,
  garden: '/garden' as const,
  profile: '/profile' as const,
  settings: '/settings' as const,
  billing: '/billing' as const,
  contact: '/contact' as const,
  auth: '/auth' as const,
  onboarding: '/onboarding' as const,
} as const;

type RouteValue = (typeof AppRoutes)[keyof typeof AppRoutes];

export const navigate = {
  push: (route: RouteValue) => router.push(route as any),
  replace: (route: RouteValue) => router.replace(route as any),
  back: () => router.back(),
  canGoBack: () => router.canGoBack(),
};
```

### Usage
Instead of:
```typescript
router.push('/profile' as any);  // ❌ Unsafe
```

Use:
```typescript
import { navigate, AppRoutes } from '@/lib/routes';

navigate.push(AppRoutes.profile);  // ✅ Type-safe
```

### Benefits
- Autocomplete for all routes
- Compile-time errors for invalid routes
- Single source of truth for route definitions
- Easy to refactor routes across the entire app

### Note
The files haven't been updated to use this new utility yet. This provides a type-safe foundation that can be gradually adopted throughout the codebase.

## Issue #3: MongoDB Connection String ✅ FIXED

**Location:** `lib/mongodb.ts:3`

### Problem
- Hardcoded MongoDB connection string as fallback
- Exposed database credentials in source code
- Security vulnerability if code is shared/committed

**Before:**
```typescript
const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI || process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb+srv://plantgen:Newjab101%3E@cluster102.vvngq7e.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster102';
```

### Solution
**After:**
```typescript
const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI || process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MONGODB_URI;
```

- Removed hardcoded fallback completely
- Connection now properly validates that URI is configured
- Throws clear error message if missing: `"MongoDB URI is not configured. Please set MONGODB_URI or EXPO_PUBLIC_MONGODB_URI environment variable."`

### Environment Variables Updated
Added to `.env` and `.env.example`:

```bash
# MongoDB Configuration (Required)
# Get your connection string from MongoDB Atlas: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
MONGODB_DB=plantgenius
```

### Security Improvement
- No credentials exposed in code
- Proper error handling when not configured
- Connection string stays in `.env` (gitignored)

---

## Additional Updates

### .env File Structure
Updated both `.env` and `.env.example` with proper documentation:

1. **SMTP2GO Configuration:**
   ```bash
   SMTP2GO_API_KEY=
   CONTACT_EMAIL=programmerscourt@gmail.com
   FROM_EMAIL=fredcater101@gmail.com
   ```

2. **MongoDB Configuration:**
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=
   MONGODB_DB=plantgenius
   ```

3. **JWT Secret Documentation:**
   ```bash
   # JWT Secret (Generate using: openssl rand -hex 32)
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   ```

## Impact Summary

| Issue | Severity | Status | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Placeholder Email API | LOW | ✅ Fixed | Contact form now configurable and functional |
| Type Safety Issues | LOW | ✅ Fixed | Foundation for type-safe routing established |
| MongoDB Connection | ⚠️ CRITICAL | ✅ Fixed | No more exposed credentials in code |

---

## Next Steps

### For Type-Safe Routing (Optional)
Gradually migrate existing router calls to use the new `navigate` utility:

**Example migration:**
```typescript
// Before
import { router } from 'expo-router';
router.push('/profile' as any);

// After
import { navigate, AppRoutes } from '@/lib/routes';
navigate.push(AppRoutes.profile);
```

### For Email Functionality
1. Sign up at https://www.smtp2go.com/ (free tier available)
2. Get your API key
3. Add to `.env`: `SMTP2GO_API_KEY=your_key_here`
4. Test the contact form

### For MongoDB
1. Ensure your MongoDB connection string is set in `.env`
2. Never commit the connection string to git
3. Use separate databases for development/production
