# Fixes Applied - Complete Summary

## Date: 2025-01-XX

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements applied to the PlantsGenius app.

---

## 1. âœ… Removed All Supabase References

### Files Modified:
- **Deleted**: `lib/supabase.ts`
- All authentication now uses the provided API at `https://api.plantsgenius.site/api`

### What Changed:
- Removed Supabase client library completely
- All backend requests now go directly to your API
- No more conflicts between Supabase and your custom API

---

## 2. âœ… Fixed User Data Display

### Files Modified:
- `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`

### What Changed:
- User's real name and email are now displayed correctly
- Fixed the issue where generic "Plant Lover" and "user@plantsgenius.com" were shown
- Now uses `user?.fullName` and `user?.email` from the authentication context
- Falls back to profile data if user data is not available

### Code Change:
```typescript
// Before:
<Text>{profile?.full_name || 'Plant Enthusiast'}</Text>
<Text>{profile?.email || 'user@plantgenius.com'}</Text>

// After:
<Text>{user?.fullName || profile?.full_name || 'Plant Enthusiast'}</Text>
<Text>{user?.email || profile?.email || 'user@plantgenius.com'}</Text>
```

## 3. âœ… Removed Diagnostic Button from Login Page

### Files Modified:
- `app/auth.tsx`

### What Changed:
- Removed the "Backend Diagnostics" button from the login screen
- Cleaner, more professional login interface
- Users no longer see developer debugging tools

---

## 4. âœ… Improved Android Image Scanning (Fail-Proof)

### Files Modified:
- `app/(tabs)/scan.tsx`
- `utils/plantIdApi.ts`

### What Changed:

#### A. Enhanced Image Copy Function
- **Android-specific optimization**: Uses base64 encoding method first for better reliability
- **iOS fallback**: Direct copy with base64 fallback if needed
- **Better error handling**: More descriptive console logs for debugging
- **File verification**: Checks if source file exists before copying
- **Platform-specific delays**: Adds appropriate delays before navigation

#### B. Camera Capture Improvements
```typescript
// Added platform-specific delays for Android
const delay = Platform.select({
  android: 300,  // 300ms for Android to ensure file is ready
  ios: 100,      // 100ms for iOS
  default: 0,
});
```

#### C. Enhanced Logging
- All image operations now have clear `[ImageCopy]` prefixed logs
- Shows file sizes, paths, and success/failure states
- Easier to debug if issues occur

---

## 5. âœ… JWT Token Storage Working Correctly

### Current Implementation:
- Tokens are stored in AsyncStorage with 30-day expiry
- Automatically refreshed on app launch if still valid
- Users remain logged in across app restarts
- Tokens are sent with all API requests via Authorization header

### Files Implementing This:
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (lines 43-56, 397-409)

---

## 6. âœ… Authentication Flow Improvements

### What's Working:

#### Sign Up:
1. User enters email, password, and full name
2. Request sent to `https://api.plantsgenius.site/api/auth/signup`
3. On success: Shows success toast with user's name
4. Stores JWT token locally for 30 days
5. Auto-logs user in and navigates to main app

#### Sign In:
1. User enters email and password
2. Request sent to `https://api.plantsgenius.site/api/auth/signin`
3. On success: Shows welcome toast with user's name
4. Stores JWT token locally for 30 days
5. Navigates to main app

#### Token Persistence:
- Token stored in AsyncStorage with key `authToken`
- Token expiry stored in AsyncStorage with key `tokenExpiry`
- User data stored in AsyncStorage with key `currentUser`
- On app launch, checks if token is still valid before making requests

---

## 7. âœ… In-App Subscription Status

### Current State:
The in-app subscription system is configured but may need Google Play Console setup:

#### What's Working:
- Subscription UI displays correctly
- Plan selection works (Basic/Premium, Monthly/Yearly)
- Payment modal shows proper pricing
- Subscription data is stored in backend

#### What May Need Setup:
- **Google Client ID** for Google Play billing
- **Google Play Console configuration**
- Product IDs registration in Play Console

#### Note:
For testing, the app simulates successful payments and creates subscriptions in the backend. For production:
1. Configure Google Play Console
2. Add product IDs
3. Test with Google Play billing sandbox

---

## 8. âœ… Error Handling Improvements

### Enhanced Error Messages:
- Network errors show user-friendly messages
- Backend unavailability suggests using Guest Mode
- Timeout errors explain the issue clearly
- Invalid credentials show specific feedback

### Example:
```typescript
// Before: "Error occurred"
// After: "Cannot connect to server. Please check your internet connection and try again."
```

---

## 9. âœ… Profile Data Flow

### How It Works Now:

1. **On Login/SignUp**:
   - User data saved to `AsyncStorage` as `currentUser`
   - JWT token saved with 30-day expiry
   - Profile data fetched from backend
   - Subscription data fetched from backend

2. **On App Launch**:
   - Check if token exists and is valid
   - Load user data from AsyncStorage
   - Fetch fresh profile and subscription data
   - Update UI with real user information

3. **Data Sources Priority**:
   ```
   user?.fullName (from auth) 
   â†’ profile?.full_name (from backend) 
   â†’ 'Plant Enthusiast' (fallback)
   ```

---

## 10. âœ… Backend API Integration

### API Endpoints Being Used:

#### Authentication:
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Create new account
- `POST /api/auth/signin` - Login existing user

#### User Management:
- `GET /api/user/{userId}` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/user/{userId}` - Update user profile
- `DELETE /api/user/{userId}` - Delete account

#### Subscription:
- `GET /api/subscription/{userId}` - Get user subscription
- `POST /api/subscription` - Create/update subscription

#### Scans:
- `GET /api/scans/{userId}` - Get daily scan count
- `POST /api/scans/{userId}/increment` - Increment scan count

### All Requests Include:
```typescript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
```

---

## 11. âœ… Plant Identification System

### Current Status: **Working**

#### API Used:
- **Pl@ntNet API** (https://my-api.plantnet.org)
- Free tier with API key included
- 500 requests per day

#### Flow:
1. User takes photo or selects from gallery
2. Image copied to permanent storage (with Android-specific handling)
3. Image sent to Pl@ntNet API
4. Results parsed and displayed
5. User can save plant to garden

#### Features:
- Confidence scoring
- Multiple species suggestions
- Reference images
- Plant care information
- Taxonomy details

---

## 12. âœ… Guest Mode

### Features:
- 2 free scans per day
- Can earn up to 2 additional scans by watching ads
- Limited garden capacity (2 plants)
- Can upgrade to paid plan anytime
- No email verification required

2. **Configure Google Play Console**: Set up in-app billing products
3. **Test subscription flow**: Use Google Play sandbox testing
4. **Add OAuth credentials**: Enable Google/Apple sign-in
5. **Production deployment**: Deploy to Google Play Store
