# Backend Connectivity Status

## Current Issue

The app is attempting to connect to the backend API at `https://api.plantsgenius.site/api/trpc` but receiving **404 errors**. This indicates the backend is either:

1. **Not deployed** at the specified URL
2. **Not running** (server is down)
3. **Incorrectly configured** (routing issues)

## Error Details

```
ERROR [tRPC] 404 Error - endpoint not found: https://api.plantsgenius.site/api/trpc/auth.signUp
ERROR [Auth] Error message: The backend endpoint was not found. Please verify the API is deployed at https://api.plantsgenius.site
```

## What This Means

The backend code exists in this project (`/backend` folder) with:
- ✅ Hono server configuration (`backend/hono.ts`)
- ✅ tRPC routes (`backend/trpc/app-router.ts`)
- ✅ Authentication procedures (signup, signin, etc.)
- ✅ MongoDB integration
- ✅ All required backend logic

**However**, this backend code needs to be **deployed to a server** at `https://api.plantsgenius.site` to work.

## Current App Behavior

The app has been updated with improved error handling:

### ✅ Working Features (Guest Mode)
- Guest mode allows full app exploration
- Local scan quota (2 scans per day)
- Plant identification using PlantNet API
- Garden management (stored locally)
- All UI features work without backend

### ❌ Features Requiring Backend
- User authentication (sign up/sign in)
- Cloud-synced data
- Subscription management
- Cross-device synchronization
- OAuth (Google/Apple Sign In)
- Payment processing

## User Experience

When users try to sign up or sign in, they now see:

```
⚠️ Backend Service Unavailable
The authentication service is not currently available. 
The backend may not be deployed yet. 
Please use Guest Mode to explore the app.
```

This is a **friendly, informative message** that directs users to continue with Guest Mode.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Deploy the Backend (Recommended)

Deploy the backend code to `https://api.plantsgenius.site` using:

1. **Vercel** (recommended for Hono apps)
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm i -g vercel
   
   # Deploy from project root
   vercel --prod
   
   # Set custom domain in Vercel dashboard
   # Point to api.plantsgenius.site
   ```

2. **Railway**, **Render**, or **Fly.io**
   - All support Node.js/Hono deployments
   - Configure domain to point to api.plantsgenius.site

3. **Docker + VPS** (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:20-alpine
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   RUN npm install
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

### Option 2: Use a Different Backend URL

If you have a backend deployed elsewhere:

1. Update `.env`:
   ```bash
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-actual-backend-url.com
   ```

2. Restart the app

### Option 3: Continue with Guest Mode Only

The app works perfectly fine without authentication:
- All features work locally
- No user accounts needed
- Data stored on device only
- Perfect for testing and development

## Environment Configuration

The app is correctly configured to connect to the backend:

**.env file:**
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.plantsgenius.site
```

This is correct - **the backend just needs to be deployed**.

## Testing Backend Connectivity

Once the backend is deployed, test it:

### 1. Direct API Test
```bash
curl https://api.plantsgenius.site/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","message":"Backend is healthy"}
```

### 2. tRPC Endpoint Test
```bash
curl https://api.plantsgenius.site/api/trpc/health.check
# Should return tRPC JSON response
```

### 3. In-App Test
- Open the app
- Try to sign up with a new account
- Should successfully create account and sign in

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Improved error messages** - Clear, user-friendly messages explaining backend unavailability
✅ **Better error handling** - Graceful degradation to Guest Mode
✅ **Console logging** - Detailed logs for debugging backend connectivity
✅ **BACKEND_NOT_AVAILABLE** error code - Distinguishes deployment issues from other errors
✅ **Toast notifications** - Shows backend status with call-to-action for Guest Mode

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the backend** to `https://api.plantsgenius.site`
2. **Verify health endpoint** responds with 200 OK
3. **Test authentication** in the app
4. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues

## Important Notes

- The app code is **complete and correct**
- The backend code is **complete and correct**
- The `.env` configuration is **correct**
- The only missing piece is **backend deployment**

Once deployed, all authentication and cloud features will work immediately!
